How to find **acceleration**?
What causes the velocity of the body to change?

```ad-definition
title:
The main objective of dynamics is to find the acceleration of an object if the conditions of its motion are known.

### <center>Newton's First Law. Interaction of Bodies and their Acceleration.</center>

What conditions must be met for the object not to change its velocity?


<center><img src="http://urlr.me/c4f6B" alt=""/></center>

```ad-definition
title: Newtonâ€™s First Law of Motion (The Law of Inertia)
There are reference frames in which an object maintains a state of rest or uniform linear motion if it is not acted upon by other objects or the action of these objects is compensated.
```

<center>Inertial Reference Frame</center>
<center>Non-inertial Reference Frame</center>

What is an inertial reference frame?
An **inertial frame of reference** is a frame of reference that is not undergoing acceleration.

In which case does the body not retain its velocity?
If the action of the bodies acting on this object is not compensated.

**Inertia** is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its velocity. This includes changes to the object's speed, or direction of motion.
The property of **inertia** inherent in all bodies is that it takes some time to change the velocity of the body.

$$\begin{align}
a_1 = \omega^2r_1 \\

The law of Additivity of Force is a consequence of *Euclidean space*.
Remember what we discussed in [[13 Relativity of Motion]].

### <center>Resultant Force.</center>

```ad-definition
title: Newton's Second Law of Motion
The resultant of all forces acting on the object is equal to the product of the mass of the object by the acceleration caused by these forces.
```
This version of the law applies to an object with a fixed mass $m$.

```ad-definition
title: Newton's First Law of Motion
There are such frames of reference in which an object maintains a state of rest or uniform linear motion if the net result of all forces acting on it is zero.
```

### <center>Galilean Principle of Relativity.</center>

The equations below are only physically valid in a Newtonian framework, and not applicable to coordinate systems moving relative to each other at speeds approaching the speed of light.
```ad-definition
title:Galilean Principle of Relativity
The laws of mechanical motion are the same in *any inertial reference frame*.

Nature doesn't depend on how we look at it. A physical process is the same no matter what perspective we use to think about it.

## <center>Forces in Nature</center>

**Four fundamental interactions**
- Gravitational (gravity)
- Electromagnetic (spring force, friction force)
- Weak (transformations of elementary particles)
- Strong (nuclear forces)


### <center>Spring Force.</center>

The spring force appears when an object is deformed.

```ad-definition
title:
Any change in size or of the form of an object is called **deformation**
```

**Types of deformation**
- tension
 <center><img src="http://urlr.me/RWcJp" alt=""/></center>
- compression
 <center><img src="http://urlr.me/x8M9D" alt=""/></center>
- bending
<center><img src="http://urlr.me/Y8Fmj" alt=""/></center>
- shift
 <center><img src="http://urlr.me/Lgm13" alt=""/></center>
- torsion
<center><img src="http://urlr.me/TCM19" alt=""/></center>

```ad-definition
title:
A deformation is called **elastic** if the object restores its shape after the interaction with the deforming factor stops.
```

```ad-definition
title:
A deformation is called **plastic** if the object does not restore its shape after the interaction with the deforming factor stops.
```



### <center>Hooke's Law.</center>

<center><img src="http://urlr.me/RtqNy" alt=""/></center>

For small deformations $l>>|x|$
- If $x>0 \ \Rightarrow F_{s_x}<0$
- If $x<0 \ \Rightarrow F_{s_x}>0$

$$\Rightarrow \vec{F}_s \propto |x|$$
$$\Large\boxed{F_s = -kx} \ \ \text{Hooke's Law}$$

```ad-definition
title: Hooke's Law
For small deformations, the spring force is directly proportional to the elongation of the object and is directed in the opposite direction to the displacement of the particles of the object.
```

### <center>The Law of Universal Gravitation.</center>

![[31.excalidraw.svg]]

```ad-definition
title: The Law of Universal Gravitation
**ALL** objects attract each other with a force of gravitational attraction. Gravity is universal. This force of gravitational attraction is directly dependent upon the masses of both objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance that separates their centers.
```

```ad-highlight
title: If two objects are of irregular form, we can divide them into small parts such that they can be considered as point particles and study the interaction between each of these pieces (integration).
```

### <center>Gravitational Constant.</center>

For calculating the gravitational constant we will consider the ineraction between an object on the surface of the Earth and the Earth.
$$mg = G \frac{mM_E}{R_e^2}$$
$$g = G \frac{M_E}{R_E^2}$$
This equation shows that the acceleration due gravity does not depend on the mass of the object as Galilei proved.
$$G=\frac{gR_E^2}{M_E}$$
$$G \approx 6.66 \cdot 10^{-11} \frac{\text{N m}^2}{\text{kg}^2}$$

What is **gravity**?

### <center>Gravity of Earth </center>

![[32.1.excalidraw.svg]]



```ad-definition
title:
**Gravity of Earth** is the force with which the Earth pulls objects.
```

<center>Dependence of the acceleration due gravity on height</center>


### <center>Weight</center>

![[32.2.excalidraw.svg]]

```ad-definition
title:
**Weight** is the force with which a body acts on a support (or suspension or other type of attachment) that prevents it from falling, arising in the field of gravity.
```

#### <center>Weightlessness</center>

```ad-definition
title:
**Weightlessness** is condition experienced while in free-fall, in which the effect of gravity is canceled by the inertial (e.g., centrifugal) force resulting from orbital flight. The term _zero gravity_ is often used to describe such a condition.
$$P<mg$$
```

#### <center>Overload</center>

```ad-definition
title:
$$P>mg$$
```

K - overload factor
$$K=\frac{P}{mg}$$
**Overload factor** is physical quantity equal to the ratio of the magnitude of the weight of the object to the magnitude of gravity of the object.

### <center>Weight at the Pole and at the Equator.</center>


<center><img src="http://urlr.me/Z5MB9" alt=""/></center>

**At the poles**
- $\vec{a}=\vec{0}$ since the object is on the axis of rotation.
 $$\vec{P} = m(\vec{g} - \vec{a}) \Rightarrow \vec{P}=m\vec{g}$$
So at the poles of any planet the weight and gravity are equal.

**At the equator**
- We need to take into account the rotation of the Earth as well. Since there is a centripetal acceleration the resultant force acting on the body is directed towards the center of the Earth, therefore the magnitude of weight of the object will be smaller than the magnitude of gravity. 
 $$F_r < mg \Rightarrow P'<mg$$
 $$\vec{P'} = m(\vec{g} - \vec{a})$$
where $\vec{a} = \vec{a}_c$, thus
 $$a=\omega^2 r \ ; \ \omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}$$
 $$\boxed{P=m(g-\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}R_E)}$$
 If we were on the equator we wouldn't notice the Earth's rotation and the equation $P=mg$ for us will be reasonable. But this contradicts to the arguments we made earlier. The mass of the object certainly does not change therefore we can conclude that the change in weight of the object is caused by the acceleration due gravity.
 So the acceleration due gravity changes by some quantity which we can measure by setting these two equations equal to each other:
 $$P'=mg' \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ P'=m(g-\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}R_E)$$
 Where $g'$ is the acceleration due gravity at the location we are.
 $$mg'=m(g-\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}R_E)$$
 $$\boxed{g'=g-\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}R_E} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \boxed{\Delta g=\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}R_E}$$
 $$\Delta g = \frac{4 \cdot 3.14^2}{(24 \cdot 3600 \text{s})^2} \cdot 6.4 \cdot 10^6 \text{m} \approx 0.034 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$$
 
**Experimental data**

At the equator $g=9.832 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$
At the poles $g=9.780 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$
$\Delta g = 0.052\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$

This error in our result follows from the fact that the shape of the Earth is not a perfect sphere, but an ellipsoid this is a consequence of rotation of the Earth.

### <center>First Cosmic Velocity.</center>

```ad-definition
title: First cosmic velocity
The first cosmic velocity is known as **the orbital velocity**, which is the least velocity of a projectile to keep the orbit around a celestial body. When the centripetal and gravitational forces are in equilibrium, the object can hold the orbit.
```

```ad-definition

The second cosmic velocity is known as **the escape velocity**. This is the velocity that escapes from the gravitational field of a celestial body.
```

### <center>Geostationary Orbit.</center>
A geostationary orbit, is a circular geosynchronous orbit 35,786 kilometres in altitude above Earth's equator and following the direction of Earth's rotation.
This particular orbit is used for meteorological and communications satellites.
The geostationary orbit is a special case of the geosynchronous orbit, which is any orbit with a period equal to Earthâ€™s rotation period.
