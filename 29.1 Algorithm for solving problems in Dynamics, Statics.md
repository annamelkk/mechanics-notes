### <center>Algorithm for solving problems in Dynamics</center>


```ad-definition
title:
An **algorithm** is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.
```

- 1 object, 1 force $\Rightarrow \ \vec{F} = m\vec{a}$
- 1 object, several forces $\Rightarrow \ \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 + ... + \vec{F}_{n} = m\vec{a}$
- several objects, several forces acting ob each object $\downarrow$

1. Write down a brief condition of the problem.
2. Make a diagram, showing all the forces acting on each of the moving objects.
3. Write down Newton's second law in vector form for each of the moving objects.
4. Choose convenient coordinate axes.
5. Write Newton's 2nd law in projections on the coordinate axes for each of the moving objects.
6. Express the projections of vectors known from the condition through vector magnitudes.
7. Write down the bonding equations.
8. Solve the resulting system of equations in general form.
9. Substitute the numerical values of physical quantities into the working equation.
10. Check the dimensions of the obtained result and check the validity of the obtained numerical value.
