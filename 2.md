### <center>Mechanical Motion</center>

**Mechanical motion**  is the change in position of a body in space relative to other bodies over time.

The *main objective of mechanics* is to indicate the position of the object at any moment of time.

## Kinematics

```ad-definition
title:
**Kinematics** is a subfield of mechanics that studies the motion of a body without analyzing its causes.
```

##### Types of Motion
- **Translational Motion** is the motion in which all points of a moving body move uniformly in the same line or direction.
	- **Translational** is called a motion in which *any* line passing through the body remains parallel to itself.
	- <center>
	<img align="center" src="http://urlr.me/PR7nt" alt="" /> </center>
	
	
	
- **Rotational** is the motion of a body in which all its points move along circles with centers lying on one line called the *axis of rotation*.
	- <center><img align="center" src="http://urlr.me/bL1Mf" alt="" /> </center>


```ad-definition
title:
A **point particle** is an object whose dimensions can be neglected in *the given problem*.
```

---

**In a space free of large objects, all directions are equivalent.** 
We say that space is *isotropic*, i.e. it has no distinguished directions with special properties. Free space is *homogeneous*, that is, it has no points with special properties.
*Time is also homogeneous:* any phenomenon occurring under the same conditions but at different points in time occur in exactly the same way.

---

The numbers that are used to set the position of a point in space are called *coordinates*.

The body relative to which the motion is considered is called the *reference body* (**observational frame of reference**).




```ad-definition
title:
The reference body, the coordinate system associated with it and the time-measuring device form the **frame of reference**.
$$\text{coordinate system} + \text{reference body} + \text{time-measuring device} = \textbf{frame of reference}$$
```

In astronomy, the **geocentric model** (also known as **geocentrism**, often exemplified specifically by the **Ptolemaic system**) is a superseded description of the Universe with Earth at the center. Under the geocentric model, the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets all orbit Earth. The geocentric model was the predominant description of the cosmos in many ancient civilizations, such as those of Aristotle in Classical Greece and Ptolemy in Roman Egypt.

**Heliocentrism** is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Universe. Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center.

#### Operations on Vectors

-   **<u>Multiplication Of Vector And Scalar Quantities</u>**
	- *Determining numerical value of the vector:* Let $\vec{b} = k \vec{a}$, where $k$ - scalar quantity, then $$b = |k|a$$
		- *Determining direction of the vector:* $$\vec{b} \ \upuparrows \ \vec{a}, \ \ \ \text{if $k >0$}$$ $$\vec{b} \ \downarrow\uparrow \ \vec{a}, \ \ \ \text{if $k < 0$}$$ $$\vec{b} = \vec{0}, \ \ \ \text{if $k = 0$}$$
		-  *Examples:*  Let $\vec{b} = 3\vec{a}; \ \ \ \vec{d} = -2\vec{a}; \ \ \ \vec{e} = -\vec{a}$

### <center>Projection of a Vector on the Coordinate Axis</center>

```ad-definition
title:
A **projection** of a vector is a scalar quantity which represents the magnitude of a vector along a certain direction.
```



*The projection of the vector on the coordinate axis is equal to the difference between the coordinates of the end of the vector and its beginning.*


$$a_x - \text{projection of vector $\vec{a}$ on $OX$}$$
$$\large \boxed{a_x = x_e - x_b}$$

- $$\boxed{a_x > 0}$$ <center><img src="http://urlr.me/pWQ6F" alt="" /></center>
- $$\boxed{a_x < 0}$$ <center><img src="http://urlr.me/Hs7LD" alt="" /></center>
- $$\boxed{a_x = 0}$$ <center><img src="http://urlr.me/RPvH2" alt="" /></center>
- $$\boxed{a_x = a}$$ <center><img src="http://urlr.me/sfqcP" alt="" /></center>
- $$\boxed{a_x = -a}$$ <center><img src="http://urlr.me/FNgkf" alt="" /></center>



**<center><u>It is IMPORTANT to remember</u></center>**
- If $\vec{a} \upuparrows OX$, then $a_x = a$ 
- If $\vec{a} \uparrow\downarrow OX$, then $a_x = -a$
- If $\vec{a} \perp OX$, then $a_x =0$

$\vec{a}$ - vector
$a$ - vector magnitude
$a_x$ - projection of the vector on $x$ axis

###### Projections of Opposite Vectors


<center><img src="http://urlr.me/PRms4" alt="" /></center>

The two right triangles formed by the vectors and a parallel line to $x$ axis are equal. Thus the base side of the triangle formed by $\vec{a}$ is equal to the base side of the triangle formed by $\vec{b}$, this follows that the distances between the start point ($x_b$) and the end point ($x_e$) are equal. From this we conclude that
$$\underbrace{ x_{e(\vec{a})} - x_{b(\vec{a})} }_{\Large a_x}= \underbrace{ x_{b(\vec{b})} - x_{e(\vec{b})} }_{\Large-b_x} \ \ \ \Rightarrow \ \ b_x = -a_x$$

The projections of opposite vectors on the coordinate axis have the *same magnitudes and opposite signs*.

---
###### <u>The relationship of the magnitude and the direction of the vector with its projections</u>

<center><img src="http://urlr.me/W4mng" alt="" /></center>

Let's say we are given $a, \ \alpha$ and we need to find projections of vector $\vec{a}$ on $x$ and $y$ axes, i.e. $a_x, \ a_y$. 
$$\frac{a_x}{a} = \cos{\alpha} \Rightarrow \large\boxed{a_x = a \cdot \cos{\alpha}}$$
$$\frac{a_y}{a} = \sin{\alpha} \Rightarrow \large\boxed{a_y = a \cdot \sin{\alpha}}$$
---

### <center>Operations on Vector Projections</center>

<center><img src="http://urlr.me/W4mng" alt="" /></center>

Let's say we are given $a_x, \ a_y$ and we need to find $a,\ \alpha$.
Refer to the right triangle above formed by vector $\vec{a}$. 
<center>By Pythagorean Theorem</center> 

$$a^2 = a_x^2+a_y^2$$ $$\boxed{ a = \sqrt{a_x^2+a_y^2} }$$
$$\sin{\alpha} = \frac{a_y}{a} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \boxed{ \sin{\alpha} = \frac{a_y}{ \sqrt{a_x^2+a_y^2} } }$$
$$\cos{\alpha} = \frac{a_x}{a} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \boxed{ \cos{\alpha} = \frac{a_x}{ \sqrt{a_x^2+a_y^2} } }$$
$$\tan{\alpha} = \frac{a_y}{a_x}$$
---
###### <u>Projection of the sum and difference of vectors</u>


<center><img src="http://urlr.me/jMtV2" alt="" /></center>



$$\vec{c} = \vec{a} + \vec{b}$$

$$\begin{align}
  c_{x} =x_{e\vec{c}} -x_{b\vec{c}} \ =\ x_{e\vec{c}} -x_{b\vec{c}} \ +\ x_{e\vec{a}} -x_{e\vec{a}}\\
 =\ x_{e\vec{c}} -x_{b\vec{c}} \ +\ x_{e\vec{a}} -x_{b\vec{b}}\\
 = \underline{ x_{e\vec{b}} } - \underline{\underline{{ x_{b\vec{a}} }}} +\ \underline{\underline{{ x_{e\vec{a}} }}} -\underline{ x_{b\vec{b}} }\\
  = (x_{e\vec{a}}-x_{b\vec{a}} ) + ( x_{e\vec{b}} - x_{b\vec{b}} ) = a_x + b_x
\end{align}
$$ 
$$c_x = a_x + b_x$$

\
$$\vec{d} = \vec{a} - \vec{b} = \vec{a} + (-\vec{b})$$ $$d_x = a_x - b_x$$
\
$$\vec{c} = \vec{a} \pm \vec{b} \ \ \Rightarrow \ \  c_x = a_x \pm b_x$$


####

**The projection of the sum (difference) of vectors on some axis is equal to the sum (difference) of the projections of these vectors on this axis.**

### <center>Uniform Linear Motion</center>

<center><img src="http://urlr.me/wpPYD" alt="" /></center>

<center>Our Objective:</center>

$$x(t), \ y(t)$$

<center>To achieve this, we need to know initial position of the object, in other words:</center>

$$x_o, \ \ y_o$$

From the graph we can see:
$$x - x_o = S_x \ \ \ \ \ \ y - y_o = S_y$$
$$\begin{align}
x(t) = x_o + s_x(t)\\
y(t) = y_o + s_y(t)
\end{align}$$
Where $x(t), \ y(t)$ - coordinates of the object at any time $t$.


```ad-definition
title:
**Uniform linear motion** is a motion in which the body makes the same (equal) *<u>displacements</u>* for *<u>any</u>* equal time intervals.
```


###### Velocity of Uniform Linear Motion
$$\vec{v} = \frac{\vec{S}}{t} \ \ \ \ \ \vec{v} = \overrightarrow{\text{const.}}$$

```ad-definition
title:
The **velocity** of uniform linear motion is a physical quantity equal to the ratio of the vector of displacement of the body to the time over which it occurred.
```

$$\vec{v} = \underbrace{ \frac{1}{t} }_{>0} \cdot \vec{S} \ \ \ \ \ \Rightarrow  \ \ \ \ \vec{v} \upuparrows \vec{S}$$

\
$$\vec{S} = \vec{v}t$$

$$ S_x = v_xt \ \ \ \ \ \ \ S_y = v_yt $$

$$   \begin{cases}
      S_x = v_xt\\
     S_y = v_yt
    \end{cases}
	\Rightarrow
	\boxed{ \begin{cases}
      x(t) = x_o + v_xt\\
     y(t) = y_o + v_yt
    \end{cases} }
$$
<center>Solution of the Main Problem of Mechanics for Uniform Linear Motion</center>

---

If the point at the initial moment of time lies on the axis and moves along (or opposite) the axis, then the velocity vector will lie on the axis, that is, it will be parallel to it.
\
Let's choose the $OX$ axis so that at the initial moment of time the point is on this axis.

<center><img src="http://urlr.me/bmhHR" alt="" /></center>

$$\begin{align}
y_o = 0\\
v_y = 0
\end{align}$$

$$\begin{align}
x(t) = x_o +v_xt\\
y(t) = 0 + 0t
\end{align}$$

Then, for this case Solution of the Main Problem of Mechanics for Uniform Linear Motion will look like:
$$\boxed{x(t) = x_o + v_xt}$$

```ad-definition

###### Example
Consider a brother and sister want to get from $\text{building 1}$ to $\text{building 2}$. The sister takes a bus and reaches to the $\text{building 2}$ in $\text{0.5 hour}$. The brother rides a  bicycle  and reaches to the $\text{building 2}$ in $\text{0.5 hour}$. Although they took different paths they have one thing in common: both brother and sister made the same displacement -  $\vec{S}_{total}$.

<center><img src="http://urlr.me/V8Dgc" alt="" /></center>

Sister  - $t = 0.5 \ \text{h} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \vec{S}_s = \vec{S}_{1_s} + \vec{S}_{2_s} + \vec{S}_{3_s}$
Brother - $t = 0.5 \ \text{h}  \ \ \ \ \ \vec{S}_b = \vec{S}_{1_b} + \vec{S}_{2_b}$
$$|\vec{v}_{ \text{avg} }| = \frac{5 \ \text{km}}{0.5 \ \text{h}} = 10 \frac{ \text{km} }{ \text{h} }$$
$$\vec{v}_{ \text{avg} } = 10 \frac{ \text{km} }{ \text{h} } \  \ \ \text{to the east}$$

###### 
$$\large \boxed{ v_{ \text{avg} } = \frac{ L_{\text{total} } }{ t_{ \text{total} } } } \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \underline{\text{average speed}}$$

###### Example

<center><img src="http://urlr.me/KBhc6" alt="" /></center>

$$v_{ \text{avg}_{OY} } = \frac{300 \ \text{km} }{3 \ \text{h} } = 100 \frac{ \text{km} }{ \text{h} }$$
$$v_{ \text{avg}_{YK} } = \frac{200 \ \text{km} }{4 \ \text{h} } = 50 \frac{ \text{km} }{ \text{h} }$$
$$v_{ \text{avg}_{OK} } = \frac{500 \ \text{km} }{7 \ \text{h} } \approx 71 \frac{ \text{km} }{ \text{h} }$$

What is [[6 Mechanical Motion]]?

### <center>Relativity of Motion</center>


Depending on in which frame of reference we study the motion, the result of this study may be completely different.

<center>Trajectory of a point on bicycle tire</center>
<center><img src="http://urlr.me/dB51P" alt="" /></center>

If the nature of motion depends on the choice of the reference frame, then one of the main characteristics of the motion - the velocity will also depend on the choice of the reference frame.

---
**<center>The space in which we work is Euclidean.
Time flows in the same way in all frames of reference. </center>**


Let's say we know how an object moves in a certain frame of reference, which moves relative to another one, the characteristics of the motion of this frame of reference are also known.
It is required to determine the velocity of the object's motion, for example, relative to the moving frame of reference.
Or conversely, the motion of the moving frame of reference is known, the motion of the object relative to a moving frame of reference is known, and then what will be the characteristics of motion relative to the another frame of reference?
\
We need to connect the velocity in different frames of reference.

###### Example

<center><img src="http://urlr.me/csJgK" alt="" /></center>



**LABELS:** $\vec{S}_{\text{abs}}$ - absolute displacement
$\vec{S}_{\text{rel}}$ - relative displacement
$\vec{S}_{\text{ext}}$ - displacement of the moving frame of reference relative to the external frame of reference
$\bullet$ - observer (frame of reference)


$$\large\vec{S}_{\text{abs}} = \vec{S}_{\text{rel}} +\vec{S}_{\text{ext}} \ \bigg\vert \ \small\frac{1}{t}$$

Now from [[10 Unifrom Linear Motion]] we need to remember the definition of **velocity** of uniform linear motion.

$$\large\underbrace{ \frac{ \vec{S}_{\text{abs}} }{t} }_{1} = \underbrace{ \frac{ \vec{S}_{\text{rel}} }{t} }_{2} + \underbrace{ \frac{ \vec{S}_{\text{ext}} }{t} }_{3}$$

$1$ - the velocity with which the object moves relative to the stationary (fixed) frame of reference 
$2$ - velocity of the object relative to the moving frame of reference
$3$ - the velocity with which the moving frame of reference moves relative to the stationary (fixed) frame of reference

$$\Large\boxed{\vec{v}_{ \text{abs} } = \vec{v}_{ \text{rel} } + \vec{v}_{ \text{ext} } }$$

```ad-definition
title:
Velocity of an object relative to a stationary (fixed) frame of reference is equal to the** vector sum** of the velocity of the object relative to the moving frame of reference and the velocity of the moving frame of reference relative to the stationary frame of reference.
```

---

###### Additional Notes

Two objects $1$ and $2$ are moving on a straight line.
Suppose that $\vec{v}_1 = \vec{v}_{\text{ext}}$ and $\vec{v}_2 = \vec{v}_{\text{abs}}$
$$\vec{v}_2 = \vec{v}_{\text{rel}} + \vec{v}_1$$
$$\vec{v}_{\text{rel}} = \vec{v}_2 - \vec{v}_2$$

**Motion in One Direction**
$$v_{\text{rel}} = v_2 - v_1$$
**Motion in Opposite Directions (meeting)**
$$v_{\text{rel}} = - v_2 - v_1 = -(v_2 + v_1)$$

$$\vec{v} = \vec{v}_o + n\Delta\vec{v}$$
If passed $t$ seconds then $n = \frac{t}{\Delta t}$
$$\vec{v} = \vec{v}_o + \frac{t}{\Delta t} \Delta \vec{v}$$
$$\vec{v} = \vec{v}_o + \underbrace{\boxed{ \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t} }}_{\text{time-independent}} \cdot t$$

###### For Uniformly Accelerated Motion 

$$\large\frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \overrightarrow{\text{const.}}$$
$$\large\boxed{\vec{a} = \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t} }  \rightarrow \text{Acceleration}$$

Acceleration is a vector quantity that **characterizes the rate of change of velocity**.

$$\begin{align}
\Delta\vec{v} = \vec{v} - \vec{v}_o\\
\Delta t =t -t_o
\end{align}$$
$$\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{v} - \vec{v}_o}{t -t_o}$$
It is more convenient when $t_o = 0$, so that
$$\large\boxed{\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{v} - \vec{v}_o}{t}}$$

```ad-definition
title:
**Acceleration** of an object in Uniformly Accelerated Motion is a physical quantity equal to the ratio of the change in velocity of the object to the time for which it occurred.
```


$$[a] = \frac{ \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} }{\text{s}} = \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$$
$$[a] = \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$$

<center>The law of change of velocity in Uniformly Accelerated Motion</center>

$$
\boxed{\begin{cases}

$$

Let $v_{o_x}>0$ then $\begin{align}a_x > 0 \rightarrow v_x \uparrow\\a_x < 0 \rightarrow v_x \downarrow\end{align}$

---

### <center>Graph of Velocity in Uniformly Accelerated Motion</center>


$$\vec{a} = \frac{ \vec{v} - \vec{v}_o }{ t}$$
$$\vec{v}(t) = \vec{v}_o + \vec{a}t$$
$$v_x(t) = v_{o_x} + a_xt \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \ v_y(t) = v_{o_y} + a_xt$$

Let's remember that for [[10 Unifrom Linear Motion]]
$$x(t) = x_o + v_xt$$
<center><img src="http://urlr.me/HzyF2" alt=""/></center>

Since $\vec{v}(t) = \vec{v}_o + \vec{a}t$ and $x(t) = x_o + v_xt$ have the same meaning mathematically, the graph for [[14 Uniformly Accelerated Motion]] will be almost the same.

#### Displacement in Uniformly Accelerated Motion

<center>Geometrical Meaning</center>

##### For an Arbitrary Motion
<center><img src="http://urlr.me/CGqPH" alt=""/></center>

$$S_x = \sum \Delta S_{x_i}$$

**CONCLUSION** For any type of motion, the area under the motion velocity graph is equal to the projection of the displacement of the object.

##### For Uniformly Accelerated Motion 
<center><img src="http://urlr.me/ksqC1" alt=""/></center>

$$v_x(t) = v_{o_x} + a_xt$$
$$\large\boxed{S_x = v_{o_x}t + \frac{a_xt^2}{2} }$$
$v_{o_x}$ - projection of the initial velocity
$a_x$ - projection of the acceleration
$t$ - passed time


$$x(t) = x_o + S_x(t)$$
$$\large\boxed{x(t) = x_o + v_{o_x}t + \frac{a_xt^2}{2} }$$

<center>Solution of the main problem of Mechanics for Uniformly Accelerated Motion</center>

$x_o$ - initial coordinate of the object

**LOOKING BACK**
For [[10 Unifrom Linear Motion]]
$$x(t) = x_o + v_xt \ \ \ \ \ \boxed{a_x = 0}$$
\
When the object is at rest $v_{o_x} = 0$,  $a_x = 0$ 
$$x(t) = x_o$$

i.e. everything we discussed before are special cases of the derived above equation.

$$\large\vec{v}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{ \vec{S} }{t}  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)$$

For Uniformly Accelerated Motion:

$$
\large\begin{rcases*}
S_x = v_{o_x}t + \frac{ a_xt }{2} \\
S_y = v_{o_y}t + \frac{ a_yt }{2} \\
S_z = v_{o_z}t + \frac{ a_zt }{2}
\end{rcases*} \ \ \rightarrow \ \ \ \boxed{ \vec{S} = \vec{v}_ot + \frac{\vec{a}t^2}{2} }
$$

$v_{o_{(x/y/z)}}$ - projection of the initial velocity
$a_{(x/y/z)}$ - projection of the acceleration

If we substitute into $(1)$ the equation we derived for $\vec{S}$, we get 
$$\vec{v}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{ \vec{v}_ot + \frac{\vec{a}t^2}{2} }{t} = \vec{v}_o + \frac{\vec{a}t}{2}$$

Now, we know that $\vec{v} = \vec{v}_o + \vec{a}t$, then $\vec{a}t = \vec{v} - \vec{v}_o$, thus
$$\vec{v}_{\text{avg} } = \vec{v}_o + \frac{  \vec{v} - \vec{v}_o }{2} = \underline{\vec{v}_o} + \frac{\vec{v}}{2} - \underline{\frac{\vec{v}_o}{2} }= \frac{\vec{v}}{2} + \frac{\vec{v}_o}{2} $$

$$\large\boxed{\vec{v}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\vec{v} + \vec{v}_o}{2} }$$

```ad-highlight
title:
In uniformly accelerated motion, the average velocity of the body is equal to **the arithmetic mean** of the initial and final velocities.
```

We know that $\vec{S} = \vec{v}_{\text{avg}} \cdot t$, from the equation above we get
 
 $$\large\boxed{ \vec{S} = \frac{ \vec{v} + \vec{v}_o }{2} \cdot t }$$
 
 For comparison take a look at $\vec{S} = \vec{v}_ot + \frac{\vec{a}t^2}{2}$.
 
 
 $$\large\boxed{\vec{v}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\vec{v} + \vec{v}_o}{2} } \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \large\boxed{ \vec{S} = \frac{ \vec{v} + \vec{v}_o }{2} \cdot t } $$

 ```ad-highlight
 title:
 In uniformly accelerated motion, the instantaneous velocity of the body coincides with the average velocity **in the middle of the time interval** in which the motion of the body is considered.
 ```
 
 ---
 
 
 ```ad-highlight
 title:
 In uniformly accelerated motion without initial velocity, **"the law of odd numbers" is held**: the distances traveled by the body in consecutive equal intervals of time are related as consecutive numbers: $$ s_1 : s_2 :  \ ... \ : s_n = 1 : 3 : \ ... \ : (2n-1)$$
 ```
 
To prove this statement, first let's label some quantities:
$v_o = 0$ (as stated)
$\tau$ - time interval size

<center><img src="http://urlr.me/trKV5" alt=""/></center>


 $$S = \underbrace{v_ot}_{=0} + \frac{at^2}{2}$$
 $$S_n = \frac{ a(n\tau)^2 }{2} - \frac{ a((n-1)\tau)^2 }{2} = \frac{a\tau^2}{2} (n^2 - (n-1)^2) = \frac{a\tau^2}{2}(n^2-n^2+2n-1)$$
 $$S_n = \frac{a\tau^2}{2}(2n-1)$$

### <center>Relation Between the Displacement of the Object with its Initial and Final Velocity in UAM</center>


We already know that 
 $$S_x = v_{o_x}t  + \frac{a_xt^2}{2} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ v_{o_x}, \ a_x, \ t$$
$$S_x = \frac{v_x + v_{o_x}}{2}\cdot t \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ v_{o_x}, \ v_x, \ t \ \ \ \  \ \ \ \  (2)$$

$$\begin{align}
v_x = v_{o_x} + a_xt\\
a_xt = v_x - v_{o_x}\\
\end{align}$$
$$t = \frac{ v_x - v_{o_x}}{a_x}$$
Substitute this equation into $(2)$
$$S_x = \frac{v_x + v_{o_x}}{2} \cdot \frac{ v_x - v_{o_x}}{a_x} = \frac{(v_x + v_{o_x})(v_x - v_{o_x})}{2a_x} = \frac{v_x^2 - v_{o_x}^2}{2a_x}.$$


$$\large\boxed{S_x = \frac{v_x^2 - v_{o_x}^2}{2a_x}} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ v_{o_x}, \ v_x, \ a_x$$

In [[14 Uniformly Accelerated Motion]] the Solution of the Main Problem of mechanics for can be found using this equation $$x(t) = x_o + v_{o_x}t + \frac{a_x t^2}{2}$$

<center>Simplest case</center>

$$x_o = 0 ,\ \ \ \ v_{o_x} = 0$$ $$x(t) = \frac{a_x}{2}\cdot t^2$$
Now let's take a look at this equation from a mathematical point of view.

**CONCLUSIONS**

The graph of Uniformly Accelerated Motion is always a parabola.
- $v_x > 0$ then the branches of the parabola are directed upwards
-  $v_x < 0$ then the branches of the parabola are directed downwards

The vertex of the parabola corresponds to the stopping point.
The greater the slope of the parabola, the higher the velocity of the body at a given time.
\
The velocity graph of Uniformly Accelerated Motion is always a straight line. The slope of this line is determined by the projection of the acceleration.
- $a_x > 0$ then the slope is positive
- $a_x < 0$ the the slope is negative

\
The acceleration graph is a horizontal line passing 
- over the time axis if $a_x > 0$
- under the time axis if $a_x < 0$.

### Free Fall. Acceleration Due to Gravity

```ad-definition
title:
The motion of a body only under the action of gravity is called **free fall**. 
```

<center><img src="http://urlr.me/Wgxtb" alt=""/></center>

<center>Galileo Galilei year, 1589</center>
Experimentally demonstrated that regardless of mass, bodies fall the same way.

---

Imagine two objects, one heavier than the other, connected to each other with a rope, and drop the bundle from a tower. If we assume that heavy objects do fall faster than light ones and vice versa, then the light object should slow down the fall of the heavy one. But since the system as a whole is heavier than a single heavy object, it must fall faster than the heavy object does. Thus, we arrive at a contradiction, from which it follows that the original assumption (heavy objects fall faster than light ones) is wrong.
\
Bodies of the same material but different weight, as well as bodies of the same volume but different material, dropping from a height arrive at the Earth at the same time.

### <center>Determination of Acceleration by Stroboscopic Method</center>



<center><img src="http://urlr.me/DqXQs" alt=""/></center> 

$\tau$ - time intervals between stroboscope flashes.

We have to express $a$ in terms of quantities we can measure.
$$v_{\text{avg}_1} = \frac{S_1}{\tau} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ v_{\text{avg}_2} = \frac{S_2}{\tau}$$

$$v_{\text{avg}_1} = \frac{v_1 + v_2}{2} \ (1) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ v_{\text{avg}_2} = \frac{v_2 + v_3}{2} \ (2)$$
$$(2)-(1)$$ $$ v_{\text{avg}_2} - v_{\text{avg}_1} = \frac{v_2 + v_3}{2} - \frac{v_1 + v_2}{2} = \frac{v_2 + v_3 - v_1 - v_2 }{2}$$

On the other hand
$$ v_{\text{avg}_2} - v_{\text{avg}_1} = \frac{S_2}{\tau} - \frac{S_1}{\tau} = \frac{S_2 - S_1}{\tau} $$

\
$$\frac{ v_3 - v_1 }{2} = \frac{S_2 - S_1}{\tau} \ \ \ \ \ \ \  v_3 - v_1 = \frac{2 (S_2 - S_1)}{\tau}$$ $$a = \frac{v_3 - v_1}{2\tau}$$
$2\tau$ passed after the magnitude of velocity changed from $v_1 \to v_3$.

$$a = \frac{2 (S_2 - S_1)}{\tau} \cdot \frac{1}{2\tau} = \frac{S_2 - S_1}{\tau^2} $$
$$\boxed{a = \frac{ S_{ \text{next} } - S_{  \text{previous} } }{\tau^2} }$$

$\large\boxed{ \text{Experiment}}$
![[20 strobe.png]]
The ruler is placed VERTICALLY.
Quantities we have to measure:
Flash frequency in the stroboscope $\nu = 30\frac{\text{flash}}{ \text{sec}}$ (device characteristics)
$x$, cm - the coordinate that changes along the ruler
$S$, cm - displacement
$S_{ \text{next} } - S_{  \text{previous}}$

<center><img src="http://urlr.me/b6nFM" alt=""/></center>

$$S_{ \text{next} } - S_{  \text{previous}} = 1.1 \cdot 10^{-2} \ \text{m}$$
$$\tau = \frac{1}{\nu} \ \ \ \ \ \boxed{a = (S_{ \text{next} } - S_{  \text{previous}})\nu^2} $$
$$a = 1.1 \cdot 10^{-2} \ \text{m} \cdot 900 \frac{1}{\text{s}^2} = 9.9 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$$

---
This method is one of the simplest, but when using it, the result has a large error.
Let's remember from [[4 Errors on Indirect Measurements]]
  If $f = x-y$, then $\Delta f = \Delta x + \Delta y$, $\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta f}{f_o} = \frac{\Delta x + \Delta y}{x_o - y_o}$.
  It is not good to construct an experimental method based on the calculation of close values.

$\large1.$ Flight time $t_f$
$$y(t_f) = 0$$
From $(2) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \large v_o\sin\alpha\cdot t_f - \frac{gt_f^2}{2} = 0$ 
- $t_f = 0$ when we just threw the object its height is also zero.
- Consider $t_f>0$ $$v_o\sin\alpha\cdot t_f - \frac{gt_f^2}{2} = 0$$ $$v_o\sin\alpha = \frac{gt_f}{2}$$ $$\large\boxed{t_f = \frac{2v_o\sin\alpha}{g}}$$
	- $t_f \sim v_o$
	- $t_f = \max$, when $\alpha = 90^{\circ}$

---

$\large2.$ The maximum lifting height of the object $h$
When $y=h \ \ \to \ \ v_y=0$
From $(4) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \large 0=v_o\sin\alpha - gt_1$ 
$t_1$ - time taken to reach the highest point
$$t_1 = \frac{v_o\sin\alpha}{g}$$ $$h=y(t)$$
\
From $(2)$
$$\large\begin{align}
h = v_o\sin\alpha \cdot t_1 - \frac{g}{2}t_1^2 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\
=v_o\sin\alpha \frac{v_o\sin\alpha}{g} - \frac{g}{2}\frac{v_o^2\sin^2\alpha}{g^2} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\ 
= \frac{v_o^2\sin^2\alpha}{g} - \frac{v_o^2\sin^2\alpha}{2g} = \frac{v_o^2\sin^2\alpha}{2g}
\end{align}
$$
$$\large\boxed{h = \frac{v_o^2\sin^2\alpha}{2g} }$$

- $h \sim v_o^2$
- $h = \max$, when $\alpha = 90^{\circ}$

---
$\large3$  Flight range $L$

$$L = x(t_f)$$

From $(1) \Rightarrow$
$$\begin{align}
L = v_o\cos\alpha \cdot t_f \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\
 = v_o\cos\alpha \cdot \frac{2v_o\sin\alpha}{g} 
\end{align}
$$

<center><img src="http://urlr.me/h37fM" alt=""/></center>

$$\large\boxed{L = \frac{v_o^2 \cdot \sin2\alpha}{g}}$$

- $L \sim v_o^2$
- $L = \max$ when $\alpha = 45^{\circ}$

Let 's say $\alpha$ is equal to some value
1. Throwing angle $\alpha$
2. Throwing angle $\beta = 90^{\circ} - \alpha$

$$\begin{align}
L = \frac{v_{o}^{2} \cdot 2\sin \beta \cos \beta }{g} = \frac{v_{o}^{2} \cdot 2\sin(90^{\circ} - \alpha )\cos(90^{\circ} - \alpha )}{g} \\
=\frac{v_{o}^{2} \cdot 2\sin \alpha \cos \alpha }{g} = L \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\end{align}
$$

That is, if we throw the object at an angle of $\alpha$ it will fly the same distance as if we threw it at an angle of $90^{\circ} - \alpha$.

---

$\large4.$Trajectory equation $y(x)$

From $(1) \ \ \ \large t = \frac{x}{v_o\cos\alpha} \ \ \to (2)$

$$y = v_o\sin\alpha \frac{x}{v_o\cos\alpha} - \frac{g}{2}\frac{x^2}{v_o^2\cos^2\alpha}$$

$$\large y = \underbrace{-\frac{g}{2v_o^2\cos^2\alpha}}_a \cdot x^2 + \underbrace{\tan\alpha}_b \cdot x$$
<center>Trajectory equation </center>

Remember $y = ax^2 + bx + c$

<center><font color="#7d8b8b"> The larger α, the smaller the cosine, the larger the sine</font></center>

- Maximal flight distance is at $45^{\circ}$
- If we throw the body twice with angles one $\alpha$ and the other $90^{\circ}-\alpha$, that is, at angles the sum of which is $90^{\circ}$, then the flight range will be less than at $45^{\circ}$, but it will be the same.

What we are considering is very simplified.
Remember that the rotation of the earth, the presence of air, the fact that the earth is round, the fact that the density of atmospheric air decreases with increasing altitude were not taken into account, we also assume that $\vec{g}=\overrightarrow{\text{const.}}$ and it does not depend on the height and horizontal coordinates.

$\varphi$ - rotation angle 

```ad-definition

**Angular velocity** of uniform rotation is a physical quantity equal to the ratio of the angle of rotation of the object to the time in which it occurred.

```ad-definition
title:
The time it takes an object to make one complete revolution is called the rotation **period**.
```

$$T \ - \ \text{rotation period}$$
$$T = \frac{t}{N} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ [T] = s$$

```ad-definition
title:
The **frequency** of rotation of an object is a physical quantity equal to the number of revolutions made by the object per unit time.

$$n \ - \ \text{frequency of rotation}$$
$$n = \frac{N}{t} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ [n] = \frac{ \text{rev} }{ \text{s} } = \frac{1}{ \text{s} } = s^{-1}$$
$$N \ - \ \text{the number of revolutions of the object}$$
$$T = \frac{1}{n} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ n = \frac{1}{T}$$
\
Angular velocity shows by what angle the object rotates in a unit of time, and frequency shows how many revolutions the object makes in a unit of time. And one revolution equals to an angle of 2$\pi$ radians.
If a object has made one complete revolution, it has rotated by $2\pi$ radians.
$$\large\boxed{ \omega = 2\pi n } \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \boxed{ \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} }$$

##### One more equation for Centripetal Acceleration

$$a_{ \text{c} } = \frac{v^2}{r}$$
$$v = \omega r$$
$$a_{ \text{c} } = \frac{ ( \omega r )^2 }{r} = \frac{\omega^2r^2}{r} = \omega^2r$$
$$\large\boxed{ a_{ \text{c} } = \omega^2r }$$
---
Let's imagine that the radius has been doubled.
<center><img src="http://urlr.me/1sLGr" alt=""/></center>

Then the angular velocity of the new point will be the same as that of the first point (they are both on the same body). So if we increase the radius of the circle by a factor of 2, then $a_{ \text{c} }$ will increase by a factor of 2. But when we increase the distance from the axis of rotation by 2 times, the linear velocity also increases by 2 times ($v = \omega r$). It turns out that the denominator increases by a factor of 2 and the numerator by a factor of 4.

---

**CONCLUSIONS**
Motion along a curved line is *always a motion with acceleration*. This acceleration is called centripetal if the object is moving uniformly.
We found that points on a rotating object, although they may have different linear velocities, they all rotate at the same angle if the object is solid.

 $v = \omega r$ (for any type of motion)
$\vec{a}_c$ is directed towards the center of the circle
$$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ a_c = \omega^2r \ \ \ \ \ \omega = \frac{\varphi}{\Delta t}$$

The formula $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$ can be used for any type of motion because it includes only the magnitude of instantaneous velocity at a given moment in time, which means that this acceleration does not depend on what this magnitude was in the previous and in the next instant. Whether it was greater or less, i.e. how the velocity changed. Or maybe it didn't change. The result does not depend on this.

Imagine that the object is moving (rotating) non-uniformly.
<center>Non-Uniform Motion</center>

$$v \neq \text{const.}$$
$$\omega = \frac{v}{r} \ \Rightarrow \ \omega \neq \text{const.}$$
$$\Delta\omega = \omega - \omega_o \ \ \ \ \text{change in angular velocity}$$
$$\large\boxed{\varepsilon = \frac{\omega - \omega_o}{\Delta t} } \ \ \ \ \ \large\boxed{\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta\omega}{\Delta t}} \ \ \ \leftarrow \ \text{Angular Acceleration}$$
For reference $\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{v} - \vec{v}_o}{\Delta t} \ , \ \vec{a} = \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t}$.
$$[\varepsilon] = \frac{\text{rad}}{\text{s}^2} = \frac{1}{\text{s}^2} = \text{s}^{-2}$$

$$v \neq v_o$$

$$\vec{a} = \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \Delta\vec{v} = \vec{v} - \vec{v}_o$$

We are talking about infinitesimal angles. In this case, for example, we can consider an isosceles triangle with two right angles at the base.

$$\Delta\vec{v} = \Delta\vec{v}_r + \Delta\vec{v}_{\tau}$$
$$\Delta\vec{v}_r \neq 0 \ \ \ \ \text{since the motion is} \ \underline{\text{curvilinear}}$$
$$\Delta\vec{v}_{\tau} \neq 0 \ \ \ \ \text{since the motion is} \ \underline{\text{non-uniform}}$$
$$\underbrace{\frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t}}_{\large\vec{a}} = \underbrace{\frac{\Delta\vec{v}_r}{\Delta t}}_{\large\vec{a}_r} + \underbrace{\frac{\Delta\vec{v}_{\tau}}{\Delta t}}_{\large\vec{a}_{\tau}}$$
$$\large\vec{a} = \vec{a}_r + \vec{a}_{\tau} \ \ \ \ \ \small(\vec{a_r} \perp \vec{a}_{\tau})$$


$$a_r = \frac{\Delta v_r}{\Delta t} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{\Delta v_r}{v_o} = \Delta\varphi$$
Since $\Delta t \to 0$, we can assume that $\Delta v_r$ equals to the length of the arc, and the angle in radians is measured using the ratio of arc length to radius.
$$a_r = v_o \underbrace{\frac{\Delta\varphi}{\Delta t}}_{\omega} = v_o \omega = \omega r \cdot \omega$$
$\Delta t \to 0$, so the angular velocity as well as the magnitude of linear velocity barely change, $\Delta t \to 0 \ \Rightarrow \ \Delta\varphi \to 0$, so $\omega_o$ is almost equal to $\omega$.
$$\Rightarrow \ a_r = \omega^2r = a_c$$

$$a_{\tau} = \frac{\Delta v_{\tau}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v - v_o}{\Delta t} = \frac{\omega r - \omega_or}{\Delta t}$$
Since $\Delta t \to 0$, $\Delta v$ and $\Delta v_{\tau}$ are almost equal.
$$r \cdot \underbrace{\frac{\omega - \omega_o}{\Delta t}}_{\large\varepsilon} = \varepsilon r$$

If the motion is non-uniform and non-linear, then
$$\vec{a} = \vec{a}_r + \vec{a}_{\tau}$$
$a_r = \omega^2r$, is directed towards the center of the circle
$a_{\tau} = \varepsilon r$, is directed tangentially to the trajectory

 $$v \uparrow \ \Rightarrow \ \alpha < 90^{\circ}$$
 
 
  <center><img src="http://urlr.me/5ckyG" alt=""/></center>

 $$v \downarrow \ \Rightarrow \ \alpha > 90^{\circ}$$ 

$$a = \sqrt{a^2_r + a^2_\tau}$$
$$a = \sqrt{(\omega^2r)^2 + (\varepsilon r)^2} \ \ \ \ \to \ \ \ \ \ a = \sqrt{(\frac{v^2}{r})^2 + (\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t})^2} $$


If we imagine that a straight line is a circle with an infinite radius, then the ratio of the square of the velocity to the radius will tend to zero and we get the well-known formula for acceleration, $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$.

$$v = \omega r$$
$$a_{n} = \frac{v^2}{r};\ \ \ \ \ \ a_{n} = \omega^2r$$

Any curvilinear motion is motion with acceleration because in its process the direction of the velocity vector changes.

Rotation is non-uniform $v \neq \text{const.} \ , \ \ \ \omega \neq \text{const.}$ 
$$\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta\omega}{\Delta t} \ \ \ \ [\varepsilon] = \frac{\text{rad}}{\text{s}^2}$$
$$a_{\tau} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}; \ \ \ \ \ \ a_{\tau} = \varepsilon r$$


### <center>Rotation With Constant Angular Acceleration</center>
Which motion is called [[14 Uniformly Accelerated Motion]]?

```ad-definition
title:
**Rotation with constant angular acceleration** is a *rotational motion* in which the angular velocity of the object changes by the same quantity in <u>any</u> equal intervals of time.
```

How we studied uniformly accelerated motion:
$$\large\vec{a} \to \vec{v}(t) \to \vec{S}(t); \ x,y,z(t)$$
