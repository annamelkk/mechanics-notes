What is [[6 Mechanical Motion]]?

### <center>Relativity of Motion</center>


Depending on in which frame of reference we study the motion, the result of this study may be completely different.

If the nature of motion depends on the choice of the reference frame, then one of the main characteristics of the motion - the velocity will also depend on the choice of the reference frame.

Let's say we know how an object moves in a certain frame of reference, which moves relative to another one, the characteristics of the motion of this frame of reference are also known.
It is required to determine the velocity of the object's motion, for example, relative to the moving frame of reference.
Or conversely, the motion of the moving frame of reference is known, the motion of the object relative to a moving frame of reference is known, and then what will be the characteristics of motion relative to the another frame of reference?
\
We need to connect the velocity in different frames of reference.

###### Example

**LABELS:** $\vec{S}_{\text{abs}}$ - absolute displacement
$\vec{S}_{\text{rel}}$ - relative displacement
$\vec{S}_{\text{ext}}$ - displacement of the moving frame of reference relative to the external frame of reference
$\bullet$ - observer (frame of reference)


$$\large\vec{S}_{\text{abs}} = \vec{S}_{\text{rel}} +\vec{S}_{\text{ext}} \ \bigg\vert \ \small\frac{1}{t}$$

Now from [[10 Unifrom Linear Motion]] we need to remember the definition of **velocity** of uniform linear motion.

$$\large\underbrace{ \frac{ \vec{S}_{\text{abs}} }{t} }_{1} = \underbrace{ \frac{ \vec{S}_{\text{rel}} }{t} }_{2} + \underbrace{ \frac{ \vec{S}_{\text{ext}} }{t} }_{3}$$

$1$ - the velocity with which the object moves relative to the stationary (fixed) frame of reference 
$2$ - velocity of the object relative to the moving frame of reference
$3$ - the velocity with which the moving frame of reference moves relative to the stationary (fixed) frame of reference

$$\Large\boxed{\vec{v}_{ \text{abs} } = \vec{v}_{ \text{rel} } + \vec{v}_{ \text{ext} } }$$

```ad-definition
title:
Velocity of an object relative to a stationary (fixed) frame of reference is equal to the** vector sum** of the velocity of the object relative to the moving frame of reference and the velocity of the moving frame of reference relative to the stationary frame of reference.
```

###### Additional Notes

Two objects $1$ and $2$ are moving on a straight line.
Suppose that $\vec{v}_1 = \vec{v}_{\text{ext}}$ and $\vec{v}_2 = \vec{v}_{\text{abs}}$
$$\vec{v}_2 = \vec{v}_{\text{rel}} + \vec{v}_1$$
$$\vec{v}_{\text{rel}} = \vec{v}_2 - \vec{v}_2$$

**Motion in One Direction**
$$v_{\text{rel}} = v_2 - v_1$$
**Motion in Opposite Directions (meeting)**
$$v_{\text{rel}} = - v_2 - v_1 = -(v_2 + v_1)$$
