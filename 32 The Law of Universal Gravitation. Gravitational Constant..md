```ad-definition
title: The Law of Universal Gravitation
**ALL** objects attract each other with a force of gravitational attraction. Gravity is universal. This force of gravitational attraction is directly dependent upon the masses of both objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance that separates their centers.
```

```ad-highlight
title: If two objects are of irregular form, we can divide them into small parts such that they can be considered as point particles and study the interaction between each of these pieces (integration).
```

### <center>Gravitational Constant.</center>

For calculating the gravitational constant we will consider the ineraction between an object on the surface of the Earth and the Earth.
$$mg = G \frac{mM_E}{R_e^2}$$
$$g = G \frac{M_E}{R_E^2}$$
This equation shows that the acceleration due gravity does not depend on the mass of the object as Galilei proved.
$$G=\frac{gR_E^2}{M_E}$$
$$G \approx 6.66 \cdot 10^{-11} \frac{\text{N m}^2}{\text{kg}^2}$$
