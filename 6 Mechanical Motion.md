### <center>Mechanical Motion</center>

**Mechanical motion**  is the change in position of a body in space relative to other bodies over time.

The *main objective of mechanics* is to indicate the position of the object at any moment of time.

## Kinematics

```ad-definition
title:
**Kinematics** is a subfield of mechanics that studies the motion of a body without analyzing its causes.
```

##### Types of Motion
- **Translational Motion** is the motion in which all points of a moving body move uniformly in the same line or direction.
	- **Translational** is called a motion in which *any* line passing through the body remains parallel to itself.

- **Rotational** is the motion of a body in which all its points move along circles with centers lying on one line called the *axis of rotation*.

A **point particle** is an object whose dimensions can be neglected in *the given problem*.

**In a space free of large objects, all directions are equivalent.** 
We say that space is *isotropic*, i.e. it has no distinguished directions with special properties. Free space is *homogeneous*, that is, it has no points with special properties.
*Time is also homogeneous:* any phenomenon occurring under the same conditions but at different points in time occur in exactly the same way.

The numbers that are used to set the position of a point in space are called *coordinates*.

The body relative to which the motion is considered is called the *reference body* (**observational frame of reference**).




```ad-definition
title:
The reference body, the coordinate system associated with it and the time-measuring device form the **frame of reference**.
$$\text{coordinate system} + \text{reference body} + \text{time-measuring device} = \textbf{frame of reference}$$

In astronomy, the **geocentric model** (also known as **geocentrism**, often exemplified specifically by the **Ptolemaic system**) is a superseded description of the Universe with Earth at the center. Under the geocentric model, the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets all orbit Earth. The geocentric model was the predominant description of the cosmos in many ancient civilizations, such as those of Aristotle in Classical Greece and Ptolemy in Roman Egypt.

**Heliocentrism** is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Universe. Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center.

**Displacement** of the object is a vector drawn from the initial position of the body to the final position.

```ad-definition
title:
The line along which the object moves is called a **trajectory**. 
The length of the trajectory is called the *distance* ($L$).
```
