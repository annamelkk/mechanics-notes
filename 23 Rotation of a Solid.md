What is rotational motion? (see [[6 Mechanical Motion]])

<center>Consider rotation of a moving tire</center>

```ad-definition
title:
The instantaneous velocity of a point on a rotating body is called **linear** velocity.
```

<font color="#7209b7"> All points will rotate by the same angle in rotational motion only for solids. </font>


```ad-definition
title:
A solid is an object in which the distance between any two points *does not change* under any conditions.
```


```ad-definition
title:
**Uniform rotation** of a body is a rotational motion in which the object rotates by equal angles in <u>any</u> equal intervals of time.
```

$$\boxed{\omega = \frac{\varphi}{t}}$$
<center>Angular velocity</center>

$\varphi$ - rotation angle 

```ad-definition
title:
**Angular velocity** of uniform rotation is a physical quantity equal to the ratio of the angle of rotation of the object to the time in which it occurred. 
```

$$[\omega] = \frac{ [\varphi] }{ [t] }  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \stackrel{\hbox{ $[t] =$ s }}{\hbox{ $[\varphi] = $radian }}$$

Consider a central angle $\varphi$

```ad-definition
title:
**$1$ radian** is the central angle resting on an arc whose length is equal to the radius.
```

$$\begin{align}
l = r \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{angle} = 1 \ \text{rad} \\
l = 0.5r \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{angle} = 0.5 \ \text{rad} \\
l = 0.1r \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{angle} = 0.1 \ \text{rad} \\
l = \varphi r \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{angle} = \varphi \ \text{rad} 
\end{align}
$$

$$\boxed{l = \varphi \cdot r} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \boxed{\varphi = \frac{l}{r}} $$


full angle $= 360^{\circ}$

<center><img src="http://urlr.me/Mb7HY" alt=""/></center>

$$\varphi_{\text{full}} = \frac{2\pi r}{r} = 2\pi \ \ \text{rad}$$

$$\begin{align}
360^{\circ} = 2\pi \ \text{rad}\\
180^{\circ} = \pi \ \text{rad}\\
\frac{ 180^{\circ} }{\pi} = 1 \ \text{rad} \approx 57.3^{\circ}
\end{align}
$$

\
$$[\omega] = \frac{\text{rad}}{s} = \frac{1}{s} = s^{-1}$$

##### Relationship between linear and anguar velocity

$$l = \varphi r \ \ \vert{\frac{1}{t}}$$
$$\underbrace{\frac{l}{t}}_{v} = \underbrace{\frac{\varphi}{t}}_{\omega}r$$
$$\large\boxed{v = \omega r}$$
$$r_A > r_B \ \Rightarrow v_A > v_B$$


```ad-definition
title:
The time it takes an object to make one complete revolution is called the rotation **period**.
```

$$T \ - \ \text{rotation period}$$
$$T = \frac{t}{N} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ [T] = s$$

```ad-definition
title:
The **frequency** of rotation of an object is a physical quantity equal to the number of revolutions made by the object per unit time.
```

$$n \ - \ \text{frequency of rotation}$$
$$n = \frac{N}{t} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ [n] = \frac{ \text{rev} }{ \text{s} } = \frac{1}{ \text{s} } = s^{-1}$$
$$N \ - \ \text{the number of revolutions of the object}$$
$$T = \frac{1}{n} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ n = \frac{1}{T}$$
\
Angular velocity shows by what angle the object rotates in a unit of time, and frequency shows how many revolutions the object makes in a unit of time. And one revolution equals to an angle of 2$\pi$ radians.
If a object has made one complete revolution, it has rotated by $2\pi$ radians.
$$\large\boxed{ \omega = 2\pi n } \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \boxed{ \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} }$$

##### One more equation for Centripetal Acceleration

$$a_{ \text{c} } = \frac{v^2}{r}$$
$$v = \omega r$$
$$a_{ \text{c} } = \frac{ ( \omega r )^2 }{r} = \frac{\omega^2r^2}{r} = \omega^2r$$
$$\large\boxed{ a_{ \text{c} } = \omega^2r }$$

Let's imagine that the radius has been doubled.

Then the angular velocity of the new point will be the same as that of the first point (they are both on the same body). So if we increase the radius of the circle by a factor of 2, then $a_{ \text{c} }$ will increase by a factor of 2. But when we increase the distance from the axis of rotation by 2 times, the linear velocity also increases by 2 times ($v = \omega r$). It turns out that the denominator increases by a factor of 2 and the numerator by a factor of 4.

**CONCLUSIONS**
Motion along a curved line is *always a motion with acceleration*. This acceleration is called centripetal if the object is moving uniformly.
We found that points on a rotating object, although they may have different linear velocities, they all rotate at the same angle if the object is solid.
