### <center>Galilean Principle of Relativity.</center>

The equations below are only physically valid in a Newtonian framework, and not applicable to coordinate systems moving relative to each other at speeds approaching the speed of light.
```ad-definition
title:Galilean Principle of Relativity
The laws of mechanical motion are the same in *any inertial reference frame*.
```
Nature doesn't depend on how we look at it. A physical process is the same no matter what perspective we use to think about it.
