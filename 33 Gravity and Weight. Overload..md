### <center>Weight</center>

![[32.2.excalidraw.svg]]

```ad-definition
title:
**Weight** is the force with which a body acts on a support (or suspension or other type of attachment) that prevents it from falling, arising in the field of gravity.
```

#### <center>Weightlessness</center>

```ad-definition
title:
**Weightlessness** is condition experienced while in free-fall, in which the effect of gravity is canceled by the inertial (e.g., centrifugal) force resulting from orbital flight. The term _zero gravity_ is often used to describe such a condition.
$$P<mg$$
```

#### <center>Overload</center>

```ad-definition
title:
$$P>mg$$
```

K - overload factor
$$K=\frac{P}{mg}$$
**Overload factor** is physical quantity equal to the ratio of the magnitude of the weight of the object to the magnitude of gravity of the object.
