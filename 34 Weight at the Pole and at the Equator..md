### <center>Weight at the Pole and at the Equator.</center>

**At the poles**
- $\vec{a}=\vec{0}$ since the object is on the axis of rotation.
 $$\vec{P} = m(\vec{g} - \vec{a}) \Rightarrow \vec{P}=m\vec{g}$$
So at the poles of any planet the weight and gravity are equal.

**At the equator**
- We need to take into account the rotation of the Earth as well. Since there is a centripetal acceleration the resultant force acting on the body is directed towards the center of the Earth, therefore the magnitude of weight of the object will be smaller than the magnitude of gravity. 
 $$F_r < mg \Rightarrow P'<mg$$
 $$\vec{P'} = m(\vec{g} - \vec{a})$$
where $\vec{a} = \vec{a}_c$, thus
 $$a=\omega^2 r \ ; \ \omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}$$
 $$\boxed{P=m(g-\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}R_E)}$$
 If we were on the equator we wouldn't notice the Earth's rotation and the equation $P=mg$ for us will be reasonable. But this contradicts to the arguments we made earlier. The mass of the object certainly does not change therefore we can conclude that the change in weight of the object is caused by the acceleration due gravity.
 So the acceleration due gravity changes by some quantity which we can measure by setting these two equations equal to each other:
 $$P'=mg' \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ P'=m(g-\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}R_E)$$
 Where $g'$ is the acceleration due gravity at the location we are.
 $$mg'=m(g-\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}R_E)$$
 $$\boxed{g'=g-\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}R_E} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \boxed{\Delta g=\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}R_E}$$
 $$\Delta g = \frac{4 \cdot 3.14^2}{(24 \cdot 3600 \text{s})^2} \cdot 6.4 \cdot 10^6 \text{m} \approx 0.034 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$$
 
**Experimental data**

At the equator $g=9.832 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$
At the poles $g=9.780 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$
$\Delta g = 0.052\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$

This error in our result follows from the fact that the shape of the Earth is not a perfect sphere, but an ellipsoid this is a consequence of rotation of the Earth.
