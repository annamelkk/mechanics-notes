### Free Fall. Acceleration Due to Gravity

```ad-definition
title:
The motion of a body only under the action of gravity is called **free fall**.

Experimentally demonstrated that regardless of mass, bodies fall the same way.

Imagine two objects, one heavier than the other, connected to each other with a rope, and drop the bundle from a tower. If we assume that heavy objects do fall faster than light ones and vice versa, then the light object should slow down the fall of the heavy one. But since the system as a whole is heavier than a single heavy object, it must fall faster than the heavy object does. Thus, we arrive at a contradiction, from which it follows that the original assumption (heavy objects fall faster than light ones) is wrong.

Bodies of the same material but different weight, as well as bodies of the same volume but different material, dropping from a height arrive at the Earth at the same time.
