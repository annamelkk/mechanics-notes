### <center>First Cosmic Velocity.</center>

```ad-definition
title: First cosmic velocity
The first cosmic velocity is known as **the orbital velocity**, which is the least velocity of a projectile to keep the orbit around a celestial body. When the centripetal and gravitational forces are in equilibrium, the object can hold the orbit.

```ad-definition
title: Second cosmic velocity
The second cosmic velocity is known as **the escape velocity**. This is the velocity that escapes from the gravitational field of a celestial body.

### <center>Geostationary Orbit.</center>
A geostationary orbit, is a circular geosynchronous orbit 35,786 kilometres in altitude above Earth's equator and following the direction of Earth's rotation.
This particular orbit is used for meteorological and communications satellites.
The geostationary orbit is a special case of the geosynchronous orbit, which is any orbit with a period equal to Earth’s rotation period.
