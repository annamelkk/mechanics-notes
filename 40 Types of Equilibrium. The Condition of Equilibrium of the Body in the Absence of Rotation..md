### <center>Types of Equilibrium. The Condition of Equilibrium of the Body in the Absence of Rotation.</center>


```ad-definition
title: 
**Equilibrium** is a state that can be maintained indefinitely in the absence of external influences.
```

```ad-definition
title: ![[39.excalidraw.svg]]
An object is in *stable* equilibrium when by deviating it from the equilibrium position, forces arise that return the object to its original position.

```

```ad-definition
title: 
An object is in *unstable* equilibrium when by deviating it from the equilibrium position, forces arise that move the object away from its original position.
```

```ad-definition
title: 
An object is in *neutral* equilibrium when by deviating it from the equilibrium position, no forces arise that return the object to its original position or that move the object away from its original position.
