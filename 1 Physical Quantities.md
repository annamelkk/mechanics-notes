### <center>Physical Quantities</center>

A **physical quantity** is a physical concept expressed by a number at the moment of measurement.

**Measurement** is the process of comparing a physical quantity with a homogeneous quantity taken as a *unit*.

 A **standard** (or **etalon**) is an object, system, or experiment for storing and reproducing a unit of physical quantity.
 
 ##### Standard of Length Measurement 
 The **metre** is currently defined as the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum in $\frac{1}{299\ 792\ 458}$ of a second.
 
 ##### Standard of Time Measurement 
In 1967 the standard of time became **second(s)**, which is $9\ 192\ 631\ 770$ times the period of vibration of radiation from the $\ce{^{133}Cs}$ (cesium) atom.
 
  ##### Standard of Mass Measurement 
  The **kilogram** is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant $h$ to be $6.626\ 070\ 15 \times 10^{-34}$ when expressed in the unit $J \cdot s$ which is equal to $\frac{kg \cdot m^2}{s}$, where the metre and the second are defined in terms of $c$ and $\Delta\nu_{Cs}$ ($Cs$ - cesium).
