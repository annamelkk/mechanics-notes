How to find **acceleration**?
What causes the velocity of the body to change?

```ad-definition
title:
The main objective of dynamics is to find the acceleration of an object if the conditions of its motion are known.

What conditions must be met for the object not to change its velocity?

```ad-definition
title: Newton’s First Law of Motion (The Law of Inertia)
There are reference frames in which an object maintains a state of rest or uniform linear motion if it is not acted upon by other objects or the action of these objects is compensated.
```

<center>Inertial Reference Frame</center>
<center>Non-inertial Reference Frame</center>

What is an inertial reference frame?
An **inertial frame of reference** is a frame of reference that is not undergoing acceleration.

In which case does the body not retain its velocity?
If the action of the bodies acting on this object is not compensated.

**Inertia** is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its velocity. This includes changes to the object's speed, or direction of motion.
The property of **inertia** inherent in all bodies is that it takes some time to change the velocity of the body.

$$\begin{align}
a_1 = \omega^2r_1 \\
a_2 = \omega^2r_2
\end{align}$$
$$\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{\omega^2r_1}{\omega^2r_2} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{r_1}{r_2}$$

<center><font color="#d8e2dc">The ratio of accelerations of objects during the interaction does not depend on the nature of motion.</font></center>


$$\boxed{\begin{align} \large\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{ \text{inertia}_2 }{ \text{inertia}_1 } \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{m_2}{m_1}  \ \ \small\stackrel{\hbox{ $m_1 \ , \ m_2$ }}{\hbox{ - masses  }} \\ \\
\large\vec{a}_1 \uparrow\downarrow \vec{a}_2 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \end{align}}$$

```ad-definition
title: Fundamental Experimental Law of Dynamics
The accelerations of objects during the interaction are directed in opposite directions, and the ratio of the magnitudes of accelerations is equal to the inverse ratio of the masses of objects.
