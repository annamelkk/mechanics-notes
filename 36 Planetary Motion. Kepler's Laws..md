```ad-definition
title: Kepler's laws of planetary motion
1.  The orbit of a planet is an **ellipse** with the Sun at one of the two foci.
2.  A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
3.  The squares of the periods of any two planets are proportional to the cubes
of the semimajor axes of their respective orbits: $T \propto a^{\frac{3}{2}}$
