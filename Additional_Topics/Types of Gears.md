**Rule:** In a pair of joined gears, if one rotates clockwise, then the other has to rotate counterclockwise.

Why are the linear velocities of the pulleys equal?
When the point on the edge of pulley 1 moves 1 cm, the belt also moves 1 cm and moves the points on the edge of pulley 2 the same distance (if the belt is not stretched and slipping). The radii of the pulleys affect the angular velocity of the pulleys, not the linear velocity.

The size of the cogs on both gears is the same. The circumference of the gear is proportional to the number of teeth, and the radius is proportional to the length of the circumference.
